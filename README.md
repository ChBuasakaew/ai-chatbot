# üêπ My Trial Chatbot 
This is a simple chatbot application built using Streamlit and Google's Gemini Generative AI model. The chatbot, named "‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà," is an intern at Kiatnakin Phatra Bank and is designed to provide information and guidance on auto finance topics. This project is part of the study for the MADT8102 course.

## Features

- Interactive chatbot interface for user input and responses.
- Utilizes Google Generative AI's Gemini model for generating responses.
- Maintains conversation history between the user and the chatbot.
- Custom introduction message from "‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà"
- Configurable using a Gemini API key for secure AI model access.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Streamlit library installed. If not installed, use the command:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit
  ```
- `google.generativeai` library installed. Install using:
  ```bash
  pip install google-generativeai
  ```

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or place the script and `README.txt` in your working directory.

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit google-generativeai
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run your_script_name.py
   ```
   Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of your Python script file.

4. The application will launch in your web browser. You will see a title and a caption mentioning "This is a part of studying MADT8102."

5. **Enter the Gemini API Key**: You will need to input a valid Gemini API Key in the provided text box to configure the chatbot. This key allows the app to interact with the Gemini model for generating responses.

6. **Interact with the Chatbot**: Once the API key is successfully configured, "‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà" will introduce herself, and you can start chatting by typing messages in the input box at the bottom.

## Code Overview

- **Gemini API Key**: The application requires a Gemini API Key, which is entered by the user to configure the generative AI model for responding to user inputs.

- **Session State**: Streamlit's session state is used to:
  - Track conversation history (`chat_history`).
  - Check if the Gemini model is configured (`gemini_configured`).
  - Determine if the introduction message has been sent (`introduction_sent`).
  - Store the model instance (`model`).

- **Introduction Message**: The chatbot sends an introduction message upon successful configuration of the Gemini model using the provided API key.

- **User Input and Bot Response**: The app captures user input, sends it to the configured Gemini model, and displays the generated response.

- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages are shown if there are issues with setting up the Gemini model or generating responses.

## Notes

- **Gemini API Key**: Make sure you have a valid API key from Google's Generative AI platform to use this application.
- **Customization**: You can customize the chatbot‚Äôs introduction message or appearance in the code as desired.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors related to the Gemini model configuration, double-check that the API key is correct and has the required permissions.
- Ensure you have internet access while running the application, as it requires connecting to the Google Generative AI API.
